Welcome to the official documentation for the **Escape Room Communication Standard (ERCS)** ‚Äî a flexible, extensible messaging specification designed to enable smart, interactive components in escape rooms to communicate seamlessly, regardless of platform or transport layer.

This standard enables escape room developers to:

- Track player progress and puzzle states across multiple devices
- Monitor hardware health and environmental sensor data
- Build thematically rich, immersive experiences using a consistent interface
- Integrate embedded systems (ESP32, Arduino), web services, and control software with ease

## üîß Key Concepts

### üß© Puzzles
Each game is composed of multiple puzzles, each themed and tracked individually.

### üì° Devices
Any interactive component (button, sensor, light, lock, etc.) that communicates via ERCS.

### üí¨ Messages
JSON-based messages represent state changes, progress, heartbeat updates, and more.

### üì¶ Capabilities
Devices advertise what they support ‚Äî inputs, outputs, sensors, and more ‚Äî at registration time.

## üöÄ Supported Transports

While ERCS defines the message structure in JSON, the actual transport layer may vary depending on the device or control system:

- USB Serial
- MQTT
- WebSockets
- HTTP(S)

---

## üîÑ Extensibility

The standard is designed to evolve. Unknown fields and new capabilities can be added without breaking existing systems using reserved areas like:

- `metadata` (for any future, non-critical information)
- `sensors[]` (for modular sensor data tracking)

---

## ü§ù Get Involved

ERCS is a collaborative effort. Contributions, suggestions, and extensions are welcome via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
